# Steamscrape

##### A Python script which uses the Steam API to scrape game data. Currently able to search for a game and print the Steam store link. Will be capable of using the store link as a secondary point from which to scrape review data in the future.

# Installation

##### Run `python main.py [GAMENAME]` in terminal.
