# Installation

##### API key generated at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
Requires local installation of the `Requests` and `bs` modules via `python -m pip install requests` and `python -m pip install bs4`

# Bugs and Updates

Currently developing a workaround for games with special characters in their titles, such as 迷雾之夏-The Vigilant Villa.
Some testers are reporting errors with being unable to find data for Terraria specifically (potentially due to being rate limited).
