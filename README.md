# Steamscrape

A simple Python script which uses the Steam API to display relevant game data.

# Installation

##### API key generated at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
The `Requests` and `bs` modules must be installed before the script can be run.

# Status

I am currently trying to develop a workaround for games with special characters in their titles, though this is a low priority at the moment.
